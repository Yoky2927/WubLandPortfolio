It's all set up for you—time to add the property magic! 😊

## Why MVC and Microservices?

MVC organizes code: Models for DB (properties table), Views for API responses, Controllers for logic (e.g., listing approval). It's clean and testable. Microservices make this independent—scales easily without affecting other parts.

## Strict but Friendly Reminder ⚠️

This is your subsystem—take full responsibility and do your best, as you'll present it on November 21, 2025, and be strictly evaluated.

**Deadlines:**
- Models/controllers by Sep 19
- Routes/integration by Oct 3
- Advanced features by Oct 17

### Why?

MVC organizes code: Models for DB (properties table), Views for API responses, Controllers for logic (e.g., listing approval). It's clean and testable. Microservices make this independent—scales easily without affecting other parts.

## Strict but Friendly Reminder ⚠️

**This is your subsystem—take full responsibility and do your best, as you'll present it on November 21, 2025, and be strictly evaluated. When your asked on what you have contributed in making this system, you'll be saying this micro-service. So be prepared, <span style="color: #ffcc00">any slopy work you do I won't be taking any responsibility for. So do your best for your own good.</span>**
